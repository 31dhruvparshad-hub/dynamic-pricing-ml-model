# Dynamic Pricing Prediction System
Pricing products optimally is critical for maximizing revenue while maintaining demand.  
This project builds a machine learning-based dynamic pricing system that predicts optimal prices using historical sales data and competitive signals.

## Solution Overview
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature engineering (discounts, competitor pricing, lagged demand)
- Regression-based ML models
- Business-driven evaluation

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost

## ML Pipeline
Raw Data → Feature Engineering → Regression Models → Evaluation → Business Insights

## Models Used
- Linear Regression
